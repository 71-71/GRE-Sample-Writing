\section{Argument}
\subsection{Time Extrapolation}
The author claims that \(\cdots\), because ({\color{red}Point out}).
This assumption is unwarranted because things rarely remain the same over the extended period of time ({\color{red}Reason}).
There are likely all kinds of difference between (past) and (present).
For example, ({\color{red}Analysis}).
And of these scenarios, if true, would serve to undermine the claim that \(\cdots\) ({\color{red}Evaluation}).

\subsection{Comparison}
The arguer's recommendation relies on what might be a poor analogy between A and B ({\color{red}Point out}).
The analogy falsely depends on the assumption that \(\cdots\) in both A and B is similar.
({\color{red}Analysis}).
In short, without accounting for such possible differences between A and B, the arguer cannot prove that B will reap the similar benefits from the proposed method ({\color{red}Evaluation}).

\subsection{Causality}
\paragraph{Non-simultaneity}
The arguer fails to establish the causal relationship between A and B ({\color{red} Point out}).
It's highly possible that other factors contribute to B ({\color{red} Reason}).
For instance, B might have resulted from C.
It is also likely that D caused B ({\color{red} Analysis}).
Lacking evidence that links A to B, it is presumptuous to suggest that A was responsible for B ({\color{red} Evaluation}).

\paragraph{Simultaneity}
Based on the fact that A occurred after/with B the editor infers that B should be responsible for A ({\color{red} Point out}).
However, the sequence of these events, in itself, does not suffice to prove that the earlier development caused the later one/another ({\color{red} Reasom}).
It might have resulted from the other reasons instead: C, D, or E, to name a few ({\color{red} Analysis}), without ruling out scenarios such as these, the editor cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between A and B upon which the editor's recommendation depends ({\color{red} Evaluation}).
