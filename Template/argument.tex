\section{Argument}
\subsection{Time Extrapolation}
The author claims that \(\cdots\), because ({\color{red}Point out}).
This assumption is unwarranted because things rarely remain the same over the extended period of time ({\color{red}Reason}).
There are likely all kinds of difference between (past) and (present).
For example, ({\color{red}Analysis}).
And of these scenarios, if true, would serve to undermine the claim that \(\cdots\) ({\color{red}Evaluation}).

\subsection{Comparison}
The arguer's recommendation relies on what might be a poor analogy between A and B ({\color{red}Point out}).
The analogy falsely depends on the assumption that \(\cdots\) in both A and B is similar.
({\color{red}Analysis}).
In short, without accounting for such possible differences between A and B, the arguer cannot prove that B will reap the similar benefits from the proposed method ({\color{red}Evaluation}).
